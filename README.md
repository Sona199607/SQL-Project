# SQL-Project

# House Price Prediction Project Using SQL

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting house prices using SQL. By leveraging a dataset containing various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities, this project aims to uncover key factors that influence house prices and to build SQL-based models to estimate house prices effectively.

## Objectives
### Primary Objective:
- **Predict house prices** by analyzing various features using SQL.

### Secondary Objectives:
- **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Perform a thorough examination of the dataset, cleaning it for accurate analysis.
- **Feature Impact Analysis:** Assess how different features like area, number of bedrooms, and amenities impact house prices.
- **SQL-Based Predictive Modeling:** Create SQL queries to estimate house prices based on selected features.
- **Reporting and Visualization:** Summarize findings with visualizations and present them in a structured report.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- `price`: The price of the house.
- `area`: The area of the house in square feet.
- `bedrooms`: The number of bedrooms.
- `bathrooms`: The number of bathrooms.
- `stories`: The number of stories in the house.
- `mainroad`: Whether the house is located on a main road (yes/no).
- `guestroom`: Presence of a guestroom (yes/no).
- `basement`: Presence of a basement (yes/no).
- `hotwaterheating`: Availability of hot water heating (yes/no).
- `airconditioning`: Availability of air conditioning (yes/no).
- `parking`: Number of parking spaces.
- `prefarea`: Whether the house is in a preferred area (yes/no).
- `furnishingstatus`: The furnishing status of the house (furnished/semi-furnished/unfurnished).

## Project Structure
- **SQL Queries:** A set of SQL queries used for data exploration, feature analysis, and price prediction.
- **Data Cleaning:** SQL scripts to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** SQL queries to explore and visualize key trends in the dataset.
- **Predictive Analysis:** SQL-based models to predict house prices based on selected features.
- **Presentation:** A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the projectâ€™s objectives, methodologies, and key findings.

## How to Use This Project
1. **Setup:** Load the provided dataset into your SQL database.
2. **Run SQL Queries:** Execute the SQL scripts provided in the `SQL_Queries.sql` file to perform data cleaning, exploration, and predictive analysis.
3. **Analyze Results:** Review the output of the SQL queries to understand the factors influencing house prices.
4. **Presentation:** Use the provided PowerPoint template to create a presentation based on your findings.

## Requirements
- **SQL Database:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other SQL-compatible database.
- **SQL Client:** Any SQL client or tool that allows you to run SQL queries.
- **Presentation Software:** Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides for creating the final presentation.

## Key SQL Queries
- **Data Exploration:** Queries to explore the dataset and summarize key statistics.
- **Data Cleaning:** Queries to handle missing values and duplicates.
- **Feature Analysis:** Queries to determine the impact of various features on house prices.
- **Predictive Modeling:** SQL scripts for estimating house prices based on selected features.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of SQL for analyzing and predicting house prices. By exploring the dataset, understanding feature impacts, and building predictive models, we gain valuable insights into the real estate market. The final presentation summarizes these findings, providing a clear view of the key factors driving house prices.
